before_install:
  ## PPA for seasonal and x13binary which are not (yet?) packaged by Michael
  ## Note, however, that the launchpad build of x13binary is BORKED:
  ## no actual binary
  - sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:edd/misc
  ## r-travis by Craig Citro et al, this covers the two PPAs by Michael
  - curl -OL http://raw.github.com/craigcitro/r-travis/master/scripts/travis-tool.sh
  - chmod 755 ./travis-tool.sh
  - ./travis-tool.sh bootstrap

install:
  - ./travis-tool.sh install_aptget r-cran-readr r-cran-dplyr r-cran-stringr r-cran-seasonal r-cran-ggplot2 r-cran-data.table r-cran-zoo r-cran-knitr
  ## repair x13binary re-install the binary which launchpad somewhat does NOT
  ## (which is probably fine on security/license grounds -- they cannot know)
  ## (and just to reiterate: this is code by the US Census Bureau which
  ##  cannot be copyrighted in the US; see the GitHub repo for more)
  ## (removed curl's '-s' for now to make download explicit)
